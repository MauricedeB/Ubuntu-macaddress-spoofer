# Ubuntu-macaddress-spoofer
This is an Ubuntu macspoofer, it uses aircrack-ng in python3. If u can improve (which u obviously can because this is my first python program) feel free to do so. 

What you'll need:
macchanger (sudo apt-get install macchanger)
A wifi adapter with the ability to put it in monitor mode, if your internal card cannot do that. 
aircrack-ng (sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng) 


HOW TO USE: 
# cd Ubuntu-macaddress-spoofer
# ls -l
# sudo chmod +x python
# ./python or bash python
